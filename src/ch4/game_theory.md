If we're going to be honest, life is a game and the world you see around you has adapted and evolved to win. Those who didn't failed, and fataly so. With this in mind, let's look at the most successful species on the planet today: humans. Humans are #winning. We have near god like powers, yet, at the heart of all our actions and desires is the will to live, and win... This means that understanding how humans play to win allows you to reason about and predict their future actions. In the context of a p2p database this means designing rewards and punishments in a way such that the participants rational, successful, survivalist instincts not only benefit them but also benefit the network as a whole. The study of this is called game theory, and in this chapter we'll explore some concepts that are direclty applicable to blockchain design.

Core Concepts
