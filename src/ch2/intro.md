    P2P "Blockchain" Network
</h1>

Welcome! This was merged with the central payment operator chapter, but now it's not. Updates to make it more relevant TBD.
- centralized state database => new p2p database structure
- trust => agreed upon pub key crypto accounts and network params (randomness + crypto basics)
- accounts => accounts created via "secure" random key generation (accounts + pub key crypto)
- tx => signed tx (tx + digital signatures)
- bank approved state transition and data storage => PoW state transition and blocks / merkle tries data storage
