Welcome! This was merged with the central payment operator chapter, but now it's not. Updates to make it more relevant TBD.
- centralized state database => new p2p database structure
- trust => agreed upon pub key crypto accounts and network params (randomness + crypto basics)
- accounts => accounts created via "secure" random key generation (accounts + pub key crypto)
- tx => signed tx (tx + digital signatures)
- bank approved state transition and data storage => PoW state transition and blocks / merkle tries data storage

Note: while we're exploring a lot of the concepts that are used in blockchain development, nothing here we're doing is a "blockchain" because no one is using/verifying/securing it besides us. The magic of blockchains is that they're a shared public resource and that everyone can use and verify/secure them.
