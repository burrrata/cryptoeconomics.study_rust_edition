# Blocks

This is where we'll create blocks, block headers, and a merkle tree of the history.

Yo what's up with those nonces?
- are they to keep track of block numbers?
- or are they for something else?

The Ethereum Whitepaper has a lot of dope knowledge on how blocks are processed and the state transition function rolls the chain. Would be nice to include that.

Note: there will be no block rewards in this demo because a centralized payment processor only needs blocks
to keep track of history, but does not need to incentivize miners to expend resources to secure the network.
It's a "blockchain" style database not a decentralize P2P blockchain, but that's for ch2!
