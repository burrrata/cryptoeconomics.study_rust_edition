# Chapter 1: centralized payment processors
They're not as boring when you roll your own! 

### TODO

hashing.md
- create a function to hash the history into "blocks"
- create a merkle tree of block hashes to make it actually like a "block" "chain"
- add rand to mdBook or find a way to create it using vanilla Rust so that mdBook builds, then update SUMMARY.md and this page with table of contents

UX
- build out individual sections leading up to the full demo
- add relevant resources to each section
- improve comments to explain what's going on

Feedback
- update Cryptoeconomics.Study post
- share to /r/ethereum
- where else?
