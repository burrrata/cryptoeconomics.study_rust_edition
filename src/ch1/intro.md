# Chapter 1: centralized payment processors
They're not as boring when you roll your own! 
- State: all the things
- Randomness: and why it matters
- Public Key Crypto: not just an account/password system
- Digital Signatures: the proof is in the pudding
- Accounts: combining these things into something useful!
- TX: using your account to do stuff!
- Hashing and Merkle Trees/Tries: keeping track of what happened
- Centralize Payment Processor: putting it all together into a working example

# GOALS
- For education purposes build a fully functional (but not secure) blockchain using standard Rust code so that the main concepts can be understood as simply as possible in mdBook or the Rust Playground.
- Then create a CLI tutorial that shows how to iteratively ugrade each component and function in the standard model to make it more secure
- Stetch Goal: work towards recreating the Parity Ethereum Client and/or arbitrary blockchain architectures like Substrate, but that's probably not realistic lol

Each chapter in the book can then evolve like this:
- goal/thing to build a toy version of (w links examples of the thing IRL)
- each page explains a part (w links to wikipedia article and production library version of the tutorial example)
- summary putting it all together (editable code you can run and play with)

Bonus points if there's a story to explain the code and concepts.
