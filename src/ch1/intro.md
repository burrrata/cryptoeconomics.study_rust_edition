    Ch1: Centralized Database Managers
</h1>

They're not as boring when you roll your own!

This chapter will explore data as we know it: in the form of a centralized financial database like PayPal or your bank. The purpose is to highlight the important working parts of the system: state, accounts, transactions, and most of all... trust. In future chapters we'll show how we can get those same properties, but in a way where everyone can verify the authenticity of the state rather than trusting the word of a for profit business. After that we'll explore the new and exciting possibilities enabled by this divergent architecture :)

Let's get started...
