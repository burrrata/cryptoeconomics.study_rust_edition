## So why this book?

Wanted to build something that runs in the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) and [mdBook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/index.html). This means no external Ethereum or crypto libraries. The goal is to explain the core concepts as simply as possible with working Rust code.
- Cryptoeconomics.Study code is written in JS and references external Ethereum libraries
- there's no functionality for accounts, keys, or tx signatures in the Rust tutorial

So here we are!
