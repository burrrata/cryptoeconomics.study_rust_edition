GOAL
- create a completely generic state with pluggable modules, then plug in various configurations to create toy examples of Bitcoin, Ethereum PoW, Ethereum PoS, Mimblewimble, etc...

STRETCH GOAL
- leave it open as a modular library so people can explore things like mimblewimble plasma (if that's even possible) or an ethereum chain of ethereum chains, or a private PoA network, or really whatever.
- then have a growing list of attacks and defenses and what cryptoeconomic mechanisms are good for what defenses or incentivizations
