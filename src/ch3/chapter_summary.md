## Words

Core Concepts
- RIP the Lorax: save the trees
- PoW is doomed to specialized ASIIC domination whereas PoS allows for more democratized access to blockchain security
- PoS also allows you to create much more interesting and compelling incentivization mechanisms such as slashing and correlated slashing whereas with PoW the attacker doesn't ever lose their compute power and they can launch multiple attacks at little to no increased cost
- PoS also lowers the barriers to entry of becomming a validator and contributing to the network :)
