## Words

Core Concepts
- PoW => PoS
- adding in support for uncles, ommers, and mixhash in addition to nonces (https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5833/why-do-we-need-both-nonce-and-mixhash-values-in-a-block) 

Uncle: See Ommer, the gender-neutral alternative to aunt/uncle.

Ommer: a child of a parent of a parent of a block that is not the parent, or more generally a child of an ancestor that is not itself an ancestor. If A is an ommer of B, B is a nibling (niece/nephew) of A.

Uncle inclusion mechanism: Ethereum has a mechanism where a block may include its uncles; this ensures that miners that create blocks that do not quite get included into the main chain can still get rewarded.
