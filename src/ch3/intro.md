    Moving towards a production ready blockchain.

<br>

In this chapter we'll explore some of the concepts and functions used in blockchain networks live in production today. Our demos won't be ready for production by any means, but hopefully this will be a nice stepping stone towards exploring blockchain and crypto libraries in the wild :)

Note: while we're exploring a lot of the concepts that are used in blockchain development, nothing here we're doing is a "blockchain" because no one is using/verifying/securing it besides us. The magic of blockchains is that they're a shared public resource and that everyone can use and verify/secure them.
