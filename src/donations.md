The best things in life are free, but for everthing else...

I hope you liked this book/tutorial and got some value out of it! I'll keep building learning tools and resources as long as I can, but it takes a lot of work and I'm doing it for free. If you feel so inspired please consider donating to support the ongoing maintenance and development of this and future books :)
