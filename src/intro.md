# Welcome!

A blockchain is, at it's heart, just a glorified database. It keeps track of stuff. The magic is that rather than the network dictating the rules users must follow, the users dictate the rules for the network. The is achieved in a variety of ways depending on the blockchain, but common stakeholders include:
- people who use the network to do stuff,
- people who develop the code that the network runs on,
- and people who contribute to the security of the network by verifying and creating blocks of transactions. 

These stakeholders are incentivized to contribute to the health and growth network because they derive value from it. This can come in the form of direct monetary incentivization for miners to verify and create blocks, developers wanting to build things that people actually use so that their dApp tokens are valued highly, or users signalling their preferences by using things they like and dropping things that don't work. If this system is balanced, secure, and correctly designed all parties involved will benefit more than they would otherwise. This magic alchemy is often referred to as cryptoeconomics. Why? Well the network is built out of code, and code can verify things and keep them secure (crypto). Also, people who use and participate in the network recieve value for doing so (economics). 

This tutorial will explore the basic components that go into building cryptoeconomic systems. This will start with the traditional centralize payment processors we know and hate, and will progressively move towards more and more decentralized systems secured and maintained through cryptoeconomics rather than corporate interests. Let the games begin! 


## Goals
- For education purposes build a fully functional (but not secure) blockchain using standard Rust code so that the main concepts can be understood as simply as possible in mdBook or the Rust Playground.
- Maybe create a CLI tutorial that shows how to iteratively ugrade each component and function in the standard model to make it more secure
- Stetch Goal: work towards recreating the Parity Ethereum Client and/or arbitrary blockchain architectures like Substrate, but that's probably not realistic lol

Chapter Framework:
- goal/thing to build a toy version of (w links examples of the thing IRL)
- each page explains a part (w links to wikipedia article and production library version of the tutorial example)
- summary putting it all together (editable code you can run and play with)

Bonus points if there's a story to explain the code and concepts.
