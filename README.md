## Problems in Search of Solutions

There is no such thing as EthCrypto for Rust. Since all the functions you need are already implimented as crates/libraries Parity just imports them. This is difficult to do in an mdBook that uses the standard Rust library because you'd have to build everything yourself from scratch. That being said... [The Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/about.html) does use examples that (I think) use non-standard libraries. 
- Question: how do we import non-standard Rust crates into mdBook?
